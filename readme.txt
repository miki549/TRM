This is a simple Matlab simulation of TRMs and the corresponsing simple observer

Files:
TRM_sim.m: the simulation script, start this at the Matlab command line
TRM_red_ode_mod.m: ode function for simulating the open loop TRM model with external in and ouflows
TRM_obsv.m: ode function for the observer
TRM_external_flows: function for defining the (time-varying) external in and ouflows
